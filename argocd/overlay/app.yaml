# manages a given Kubnernetes application via Kustomize or Helm

# if using apps.yaml App-of-Apps pattern you can just drop this into the argocd/apps directory in git to add it dynamically,
# or conversely delete or rename it to a different suffix such .disabled to have it auto-removed from ArgoCD apps

kind: Application
metadata:
  # XXX: Edit
  name: APP
  namespace: argocd  # must be whichever namespace you installed ArgoCD to - usually 'argocd' by default

    # Kustomize / Manifests (including Kustomize+Helm)
    #
    # XXX: Edit - url to Git repo containing your k8s manifests
    #repoURL: git@github.com:argoproj/argocd-example-apps.git
    # XXX: use https url for repo if using Kustomize external tagged bases to same private repo requiring authentication - alternatively see solution git-askpass.repo-server.jsonpatch.yaml
    repoURL: https://github.com/argoproj/argocd-example-apps.git  # keep .git suffix for GitLab, otherwise it'll 301 redirect which ArgoCD doesn't follow
    targetRevision: HEAD
    # XXX: Edit - path to k8s manifiests
    path: dir/path/to/k8s/manifests  # relative to root of git repo so no leading slash

    # ================================================
    # straight Helm (prefer Kustomize way above as it's more declarative)

    # XXX: values file must be set non-GitOps, eg:
    #
    #       argocd app set APP --values values.yaml

    #    <some_yaml>
  destination:
    # prefer name over server now, it's less error prone
    #server: https://kubernetes.default.svc
    # XXX: Edit - set to whatever you named your Kubernetes clusters in ArgoCD if deploying to external clusters
    name: in-cluster  # must match the NAME field in the /settings/clusters page
    # XXX: Edit - where to deploy APP to
    namespace: NAMESPACE

      - ApplyOutOfSyncOnly=false  # true is quicker but doesn't record history, cannot rollback, and hooks aren't run
      #- CreateNamespace=true  # prefer to put the namespace in the Kustomization for portability
      #- ServerSideApply=true  # ArgoCD 2.5+ to avoid "Too long: must have at most 262144 bytes" error caused by large CRDs
