apiVersion: traefik.containo.us/v1alpha1
kind: IngressRoute
metadata:
  name: traefik-dashboard-tls  # must differentiate it from the default traefik-dashboard ingress created by Helm which is needed to route to api@internal
spec:
  entryPoints:
    - websecure
  routes:
    # Gets '404 page not found'
    #- match: Host(`traefik.DOMAIN.COM`) && (PathPrefix(`/dashboard`) || PathPrefix(`/api`))
    #  kind: Rule

          port: 9000
      middlewares:
        - name: dashboard-basic-auth  # doesn't require namespace prefix unlike regular ingress annotations

  tls:
    secretName: traefik-dashboard-tls
  # XXX: doesn't work with more than 1 pod - requires Enterprise Edition :-(
  #      also must configure letsencrypt for Traefik specifically in values.yaml instead of just riding Cert Manager like with regular ingresses
  #      create Cert Manager certificate request separately instead and point it to the secret
  #  certResolver: letsencrypt
